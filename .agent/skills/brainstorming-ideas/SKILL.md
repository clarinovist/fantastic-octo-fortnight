# Brainstorming Ideas

## When to use this skill
- Before creating new features or components.
- When requirements are vague or high-level.
- To explore design alternatives and trade-offs.

## Workflow
- [ ] Check current project state (files, docs).
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions (one at a time).
- [ ] Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs.
- [ ] Present design in small sections for validation.
- [ ] Write validated design to `docs/plans/`.

## Instructions
**Understanding the Idea**:
- Ask questions one at a time.
- Prefer multiple choice questions.
- Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.

**Exploring Approaches**:
- Always propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs.
- Explain reasoning for your recommendation.

**Presenting Design**:
- Break into 200-300 word sections.
- Validate after each section ("Does this look right so far?").
- Cover: Architecture, Components, Data Flow, Error Handling, Testing.

**Output**:
- Save design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- Ask to proceed to planning skill.

## Key Principles
- One question at a time.
- YAGNI ruthlessly.
- Incremental validation.
